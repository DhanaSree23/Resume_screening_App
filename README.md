Resume Classification Project: Streamlining Recruitment with Machine Learning

Developed a Resume Classification App that leverages machine learning to automate and streamline the recruitment process. The app classifies resumes into various job categories, such as Data Science, Business Analyst, Software Development, etc., ensuring quick and efficient candidate screening.

Key features include:

Model Training: Utilized TF-IDF for feature extraction and a classification model trained using logistic regression to predict job roles based on resume content. Web App Development: Built an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to upload resumes in TXT or PDF format for instant classification. Data Cleaning: Implemented robust text preprocessing techniques to clean and normalize resume content, enhancing model accuracy.
